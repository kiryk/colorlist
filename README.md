# colorlist

Print image colors' rank based on their frequency

I have uploaded this tool mainly for myself; it helps with finding nice color schemes for websites and stuff by taking inspiration from nature.

The best results are usually achieved by looking at the rarest colors in ranks made from bright and colorful images.

For help, run the program with `-h` flag.
