# colorlist

Create colors' rank based on their frequency on a given image. It supports PNG, JPEG, BMP and a few other formats.

I have created this tool mainly for myself; it helps with finding nice color schemes for websites and stuff by taking inspiration from nature.

The best results are usually achieved by looking at the rarest colors in ranks made from bright and colorful photos.

For help, run the program with `-h` flag.
