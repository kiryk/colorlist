# colorlist

Create colors' rank based on their frequency on a given image. So far it supports PNG only.

I have created this tool mainly for myself; it helps with finding nice palettes for websites and stuff by taking inspiration from nature.

The best results are usually achieved by looking at the rarest colors in ranks made from bright and colorful photos.

You can use the program by dragging & dropping the image on the program's icon, or through commandline. For help, run the program with `-h` flag.
